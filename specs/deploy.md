# Deploy

This is a maintainer runbook for the ClawHub project. It is intentionally kept
under `specs/` so it does not publish into the user-facing ClawHub docs tab.

ClawHub is two deployables:

- Web app (TanStack Start) -> typically Vercel.
- Convex backend -> Convex deployment (serves `/api/...` routes).

## 1) Deploy Convex

From your local machine:

```bash
bunx convex env set APP_BUILD_SHA "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --prod
bunx convex env set APP_DEPLOYED_AT "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")" --prod
bunx convex deploy
```

Or use the GitHub Actions pipeline:

```bash
gh workflow run deploy.yml --repo openclaw/clawhub --ref main
```

Production deploy notes:

- `deploy.yml` is manual-only (`workflow_dispatch`). Merging to `main` does not deploy.
- The workflow must be started from `main`.
- The catalog-taxonomy digest and high-/medium-confidence classification rollout migrations were
  one-time production operations and are no longer part of the deploy checklist.
- While `migrations:runCatalogMetadataCanonicalization` exists, backend deploys that include it require
  an operator to dry-run, explicitly apply, and verify both tracked migrations before inferred-topic
  and inferred-category compatibility can be removed:

  ```bash
  bunx convex run migrations:runCatalogMetadataCanonicalization '{"dryRun":true}' --prod
  bunx convex run migrations:runCatalogMetadataCanonicalization \
    '{"dryRun":false,"confirm":"canonicalize-catalog-metadata"}' --prod
  bunx convex run --component migrations lib:getStatus --watch --prod
  ```

- Deploy targets:
  - `full`: deploy Convex, verify contract, wait for the matching Vercel production deploy, then run smoke tests
  - `backend`: deploy Convex, verify contract, then run smoke tests against current production
  - `frontend`: wait for the Vercel production deploy for the selected `main` SHA, then run smoke tests
- `frontend` does not call `vercel deploy` directly yet. It relies on the existing Vercel Git-based production deploy for that SHA.
- The real deploy job uses the GitHub `Production` environment for deploy secrets, but it does not wait for a separate approval.
- Required `Production` environment secret: `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`.
- Optional `Production` environment secret: `PLAYWRIGHT_AUTH_STORAGE_STATE_JSON` for authenticated smoke coverage.

## CLI npm release

The `clawhub` CLI package is released separately from the app deploy.
Only stable releases are supported here: `vX.Y.Z`.

Use the GitHub Actions workflow:

```bash
gh workflow run clawhub-cli-npm-release.yml \
  --repo openclaw/clawhub \
  --ref main \
  -f tag=v0.11.0 \
  -f preflight_only=true
```

Then rerun the same workflow from `main` with:

- the same `tag`
- `preflight_only=false`
- `preflight_run_id=<successful preflight run id>`

CLI release notes:

- Real publishes are manual-only and require the workflow to be started from `main`.
- The publish job waits at the GitHub `npm-release` environment for approval.
- npm auth is handled through npm trusted publishing, not an `NPM_TOKEN`.
- npm trusted publisher must be configured for package `clawhub` with repository `openclaw/clawhub`, workflow `clawhub-cli-npm-release.yml`, and environment `npm-release`.
- After a successful npm publish, the workflow creates or updates the matching GitHub Release from the `CHANGELOG.md` section and appends npm tarball/integrity proof.

If npm publish succeeds but GitHub Release creation needs repair, rerun the
GitHub Release workflow without publishing to npm again:

```bash
gh workflow run clawhub-cli-github-release.yml \
  --repo openclaw/clawhub \
  --ref main \
  -f tag=v0.11.0 \
  -f preflight_run_id=<successful preflight run id> \
  -f update_existing=false
```

If the original publish workflow failed after npm publish while creating the
GitHub Release, omit `publish_run_id`; the repair workflow accepts only
successful proof run ids.

Use `update_existing=true` only when intentionally replacing the body for an
existing GitHub Release.

That workflow assumes Vercel Git integration is enabled for this repo. It does
not run `vercel deploy` directly; frontend-related steps wait for the GitHub
commit status `Vercel - clawhub` for the selected SHA, then run smoke tests
against production.

Ensure Convex env is set (auth + embeddings):

- `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`
- `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`
- `CONVEX_SITE_URL`
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `JWKS`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY` for account-ban notification email
- `CLAWHUB_SECURITY_EMAIL_FROM` for the outbound From header, defaulting to
  `ClawHub Security <noreply@notifications.openclaw.ai>` on the verified Resend
  domain
- `CLAWHUB_NOREPLY_FROM` for guarded staff emails, defaulting to
  `ClawHub <noreply@notifications.openclaw.ai>` on the verified Resend domain
- `SITE_URL` (your web app URL)
- Optional webhook env (see `docs/webhook.md`)
- Recommended GitHub App env for authenticated GitHub API reads used by publish
  gates:
  - `GITHUB_APP_ID`
  - `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`
  - `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Optional fallback: `GITHUB_TOKEN` (used when GitHub App auth is unavailable,
  and for arbitrary public repository lookups such as trusted-publisher setup)

Do not set `TRUST_FORWARDED_IPS=true` while the Convex `*.convex.site` HTTP
origin remains publicly reachable. That flag makes rate limits and download
metrics trust forwarded client IP headers, so it is only safe behind a
header-sanitizing edge that prevents direct origin requests.

## 2) Deploy web app (Vercel)

Set env vars:

- `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
- `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` (Convex "site" URL)
- `CONVEX_SITE_URL` (same value; used by auth provider config)
- `SITE_URL` (web app URL)
- `VITE_APP_BUILD_SHA` (set to the same commit SHA stamped into Convex)

Deploy order:

1. Convex
2. contract verify
3. wait for Vercel production deploy for the same Git SHA
4. smoke

### Disposable PR previews

Vercel Preview builds use `bun run build:vercel`. The build entrypoint requires a
Convex Preview deploy key, recreates the branch's Convex preview with
`--preview-create`, builds the frontend with that deployment's URL, and runs
`previewSeed:seed`.

One-time setup:

1. In the Convex project settings, generate a Preview deploy key.
2. In the Vercel project, set `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` to that key for the **Preview**
   environment only.
3. In the Convex project default environment variables for Preview deployments,
   set:
   - `CLAWHUB_PREVIEW=1`
   - `CLAWHUB_DISABLE_CRONS=1`
4. Do not copy production auth, email, webhook, scanner, worker, backup, or
   user-channel secrets into Preview defaults.
5. Remove `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` from the Vercel **Production** environment if it
   exists. Production Convex deploys remain manual-only through
   `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

The preview seed fails closed unless `CLAWHUB_PREVIEW=1` is present and also
rejects the production Convex deployment. It installs a small deterministic
catalog plus synthetic clean, suspicious, and malicious presentation states.
Running it again resets and recreates the same fixture rows.

Preview browser traffic is public and read-only. Nitro rejects non-GET/HEAD
requests before proxying and adds `X-ClawHub-Preview-Backend` to proxied preview
responses so smoke proof can record the paired non-secret deployment name.
Authenticated write flows belong in the permanent test environment.

## 3) Route `/api/*` to Convex

Nitro handles `/api/**` and `/v1/feeds/**` through the environment-aware Convex
proxy in `server/convexProxy.ts`. The target comes from the build's
`VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL`, or is derived from the paired `VITE_CONVEX_URL`. Those
build-time values are compiled into the Nitro server output so stale Vercel
runtime variables cannot redirect a Preview deployment to production.

Do not add a production deployment hostname back to `vercel.json`. Static
rewrites would make Vercel previews query production even when their Convex
client points at a disposable backend.

For self-hosting, set `VITE_CONVEX_URL` and optionally
`VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` to the intended deployment before building.

## 4) Registry discovery

The CLI can discover the API base from:

1. explicit CLI/env override
2. configured registry URL
3. site URL registry metadata

Keep production rewrites and discovery metadata aligned before release.

### Hosted feeds

Refresh the OpenClaw hosted plugin and skill feeds after the production Convex
deployment has the catalog projections:

```bash
gh workflow run publish-catalog-feed.yml --repo openclaw/clawhub --ref main
```

The workflow stores both current feed snapshots in Convex and serves them
through `/v1/feeds/plugins` and `/v1/feeds/skills` with public edge-cache
validators. The unversioned `/feeds/plugins` and `/feeds/skills` paths redirect
to their versioned routes. Attach `registry.openclaw.ai` to the same Vercel
project before configuring OpenClaw's default feed URLs.

Production backend deploys publish an initial promotions snapshot after Convex
deploys. Active promotion changes then refresh the stored snapshot immediately,
schedule refreshes at launch and expiry boundaries, and use a six-hour cron as
an expiry backstop. The feed is served through `/v1/feeds/promotions`, with
`/feeds/promotions` redirecting to the versioned route.

## 5) Post-deploy checks

Run the contract verifier and smoke tests against production after deploy:

```bash
bun run verify:convex-contract -- --prod
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://clawhub.ai bunx playwright test e2e/menu-smoke.pw.test.ts e2e/upload-auth-smoke.pw.test.ts
```
