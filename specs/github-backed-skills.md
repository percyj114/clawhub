# GitHub-backed skills

GitHub-backed skills are source-backed ClawHub catalog entries. ClawHub indexes
metadata, security state, and display content, but the install artifact remains
the upstream GitHub repository at a specific commit.

This exists for trusted upstream catalogs such as `NVIDIA/skills`, where the
publisher wants one canonical source of truth and does not want ClawHub to
republish byte copies as if they were ClawHub-owned artifacts.

## Model

There are two ClawHub skill models:

- Hosted upload: ClawHub stores versioned skill artifacts and installs from
  ClawHub bytes.
- GitHub-backed: ClawHub stores catalog metadata and cached Markdown for display,
  then install/update resolves to GitHub source bytes at a commit.

For GitHub-backed skills, `skills.latestVersionId` is normally absent. The real
install identity is the GitHub commit and skill-folder content hash:

- `githubCurrentCommit`: upstream repo commit currently known by ClawHub
- `githubCurrentContentHash`: hash of the skill folder content at that commit
- `githubScanStatus`: ClawHub security result for that exact content hash

If an upstream manifest includes a version-like field for a skill, ClawHub may
display it, but it is not the install identity. The commit is the install
version.

## Source Tables

`githubSkillSources` represents a synced GitHub skills repository:

- `repo`: GitHub `owner/repo`, for example `NVIDIA/skills`
- `ownerPublisherId`: ClawHub publisher that owns the synced catalog
- `defaultBranch`: optional branch value discovered from GitHub
- `displayManifestKind`: currently only `skills.sh`
- `displayManifestCommit`, `displayManifestHash`, `displayManifestFetchedAt`
- `displayManifestStatus` and `displayManifest`
- sync status and invalid-skill diagnostics

`githubSkillContents` stores display-only content for individual source-backed
skills:

- `skillMarkdown` and source path for `SKILL.md`
- optional `skillCardMarkdown` and source path for `skill-card.md`
- `githubCommit` and `githubContentHash` that the cached content came from

This table is not an install artifact store. OpenClaw must not install from
`githubSkillContents`.

## Dark skills.sh discovery metadata

The skills.sh discovery pipeline has a separate hidden metadata table and does
not create or mutate `skills` rows during its planning gates.

- A discovery row keeps the immutable GitHub owner ID plus exact repository,
  path, commit, folder content hash, source URL, and source snapshot.
- Native reconciliation is advisory metadata only. It classifies an observation
  as new, an exact native GitHub-source match, or a slug/route collision.
- Exact matches may record the native download count for readback, but discovery
  must not patch that count or any other native field.
- A verified GitHub owner may create a claim opportunity marker. That marker is
  not publisher attachment, ownership, profile content, or claim execution.
- Hidden discovery rows are never installable and cannot become public through
  the discovery control plane.
- The permanent Test canary uses one committed skills.sh observation fixture,
  while GitHub owner, repository, commit, path, and content verification remain
  live and authenticated.
- Canary rollback may delete only the controlled hidden fixture row. It must
  leave native skills, download history, scan jobs, publishers, and aliases
  unchanged.

## Mirrored skill adoption

Adoption is an explicit authenticated workflow, not a side effect of discovery
or matching publisher names.

- Personal adoption compares the current user's immutable GitHub provider
  account ID with the mirrored entry's immutable `githubOwnerId`.
- Organization adoption requires the publisher's matching immutable
  `githubOrgId` plus a current active GitHub organization membership with
  `role=admin`. Membership proof older than 15 minutes fails closed.
- The preview freezes and displays the exact repository, path, commit, folder
  content hash, mirror source-content hash, and destination route.
- If the selected publisher already owns the destination skill, the preview
  identifies that exact skill and shows the retained identity, downloads,
  bookmarks, comments, official state, versions, and audit history.
- A directly uploaded or otherwise unrelated same-slug skill is still an
  eligible controlled destination. No prior source match is required because
  the verified owner explicitly confirms the canonical-source switch.
- The request also freezes the destination's active version and canonical
  source fingerprint. Same-row content or source changes while scanning make
  the request stale.
- Any existing destination alias, ownership-verification mismatch, or mirrored
  source drift blocks the request. The frozen destination includes its
  publisher route; a route or content change while scanning makes the request
  stale and requires a new preview and confirmation.

The per-item start input is intentionally narrow so single and bulk workflows
share one authorization boundary:

```text
{ publisherId, externalId, sourceContentHash, idempotencyKey }
```

The interactive `startInteractive` mutation also requires the preview's
destination fingerprint and fails if that exact destination changed before the
request mutation. The bulk `start` port remains exactly compatible with the
four exact-source fields above and reclassifies the destination atomically.

The idempotency key is deterministic for the publisher and exact mirrored
fingerprint. Starting an adoption persists a durable frozen request in
`skillsShAdoptions`; it does not attach the entry to a publisher or mutate a
native skill. A stale or canceled request can be confirmed again as a new
attempt with the same deterministic exact-source idempotency key.

The adoption states are:

```text
pending_scan -> ready_to_promote
             -> rejected
             -> stale
             -> canceled
ready_to_promote -> promoted
```

Only a real ClawHub scan execution created after the adoption request, matching
every frozen source field, and durably bound to exactly one adoption may move
the request to `ready_to_promote`. The catalog run, attempt, scan request, and
worker job must all be newer than the adoption; terminal completion timestamps
must also be post-request, so a fresh wrapper cannot reuse an older result.
In the current Local/Test-only producer contract, `dispatchKind: "real"` marks
that execution while the shared job source remains `skills-sh-catalog-test`;
production source expansion belongs to the later shared mirror/schema lane.
Clean and suspicious verdicts are eligible; malicious and failed verdicts
reject the request. A canceled attempt clears the binding and leaves the
adoption pending for a later scan. Final scan dispatch and native promotion
integration remain separate: the current groundwork stops at
`ready_to_promote`.

Promotion must revalidate the frozen destination in the same transaction. A new
destination creates the native skill. A controlled existing destination keeps
the same `skills` row, route, metrics, bookmarks, comments, official state,
versions, and audit history; only active content and canonical source may
change. Pending, rejected, stale, or canceled requests leave both the mirrored
entry and any existing native skill untouched.

`skills` stores the public catalog row and install state:

- `installKind: "github"`
- `githubSourceId`
- `githubPath`
- `githubHasSkillCard`
- `githubCurrentCommit`
- `githubCurrentContentHash`
- `githubCurrentStatus`: `present`, `missing`, or `unknown`
- `githubCurrentCheckedAt`
- `githubScanStatus`: `pending`, `clean`, `suspicious`, `malicious`, or `failed`
- `githubRemovedAt`

## Permanent external skills.sh mirror

The full authenticated skills.sh mirror is separate from both native `skills`
and the controlled scan-admission catalog. It stores source observations in
`skillsShMirrorDigests` and bounded detail content in `skillsShMirrorDetails`;
controls, durable run cursors, and conflicts remain in their own mirror tables.

- GitHub identities are exact `owner/repo/slug` values. Well-known identities
  are exact `sourceHost/slug` values and must not invent a repository owner.
- Every digest is permanently `publicVisible: false` and `installable: false`.
  Mirror ingestion never creates native skills, publisher attachment, claims,
  scan plans, or scan jobs.
- The digest stores normalized slug/display-name fields and a lean
  `searchText`. Exact, prefix, first-token, popularity, freshness, and
  full-text indexes are staged before activation on the permanent Test corpus.
- Gen Agent Trust Hub, Socket, and Snyk observations are stored independently
  with a bounded status plus optional source timestamp and source link. These
  are upstream claims only and must never be serialized as a ClawHub verdict.
- Detail storage retains at most one preferred `SKILL.md` or `README.md`,
  capped at 64 KiB. The complete upstream file tree is never persisted for an
  unclaimed mirror row.
- Snapshot ingestion uses bounded page/offset cursors. Pause is checked before
  another source batch is fetched; resume continues at the exact stored cursor.
  Reconciliation tombstones disappeared rows and reactivates later
  observations without deleting or changing native skills.
- The mirror has no scheduler in this stage. Production activation, public
  search/detail/install behavior, claims, and publisher attachment require
  separately accepted work.

## Publisher Gate

GitHub-backed source sync is official-publisher-only for now.

Official means an exact row exists in `officialPublishers` for the publisher.
It is not inherited from org membership, GitHub identity, OIDC, or
`trustedPublisher`.

Default official publishers are not seeded from deploy. Maintainers should mark
official publishers explicitly using the moderation/admin CLI before enabling
their source sync.

## Sync

ClawHub owns the sync loop. Upstream repositories do not push payloads into
ClawHub.

The production cron runs every 15 minutes:

```text
github-skill-source-sync -> githubSkillSyncNode.syncGitHubSkillSourcesInternal
```

That cron runs in Convex's Node runtime because fetching and expanding a source
archive can exceed the default action runtime's memory limit. It fetches the
current public GitHub repo, reads `skills.sh.json`, builds a source snapshot, and
applies it to ClawHub. Pagination must use a stable source cursor, not
`updatedAt`, because syncing a row updates the row. Cursor continuations must
remain on the Node runtime action. Per-skill verification also fetches and
expands the source archive, so verification actions must run in the Node runtime
as well.

Sync must not pass the full repo Markdown payload through one large Convex
mutation. The intended split is:

1. Apply source metadata and skill state.
2. Fetch small target rows for changed/current skills.
3. Persist `SKILL.md` / `skill-card.md` content per skill.

Source discovery treats the repo's `skills/` tree as the canonical catalog area.
If package directories also contain copied skill folders that normalize to the
same slug, and exactly one matching `SKILL.md` path lives under `skills/`, sync
uses that catalog path. If two or more catalog paths normalize to the same slug,
sync rejects the repo with a client-visible validation error.

## Manifest Rendering

The only supported display manifest today is `skills.sh.json`.

ClawHub parses it into the structured `displayManifest` shape used by publisher
profile rendering. The UI should not interpret arbitrary raw manifest JSON at
render time.

Unsupported, invalid, or missing manifest data should not block the source sync.
The catalog can still render skills in the normal fallback order.

Repo labels such as `NVIDIA/skills` and "Source-backed" chrome are implementation
details and should not be required visible UI copy.

## Security Invariants

GitHub-backed security scanning follows the same core invariant as hosted
uploads:

> A normal install/update may only install content whose exact current content
> hash has a completed, non-blocked ClawHub scan result.

When a new source-backed skill appears or an existing skill's content hash
changes:

- set `githubScanStatus: "pending"`
- keep the catalog entry visible with `moderationReason: "pending.scan"`, while
  blocking normal install/update until the full scan completes
- fetch the exact skill-folder bytes for the current commit and content hash
- store those bytes only in ephemeral Convex storage, referenced by the
  `skillScanRequests` row through a prepare, bounded chunk append, and finalize
  sequence so no action-to-mutation argument carries the full file manifest;
  create the request before storing blobs and persist ownership after each
  bounded chunk so a terminated action can orphan at most its current chunk
- cap the persisted file manifest at 4 MiB of descriptor metadata and hydrate
  one signed-URL-heavy worker job per claim response
- enqueue the normal full ClawScan worker with deterministic static findings as
  input context
- do not schedule another heavy verification action while that content hash
  already has an active queued/running scan job or a recently prepared request
- enqueue explicit owner/moderator rescans in the high-priority manual queue

When verification succeeds cleanly:

- persist the completed ClawScan, SkillSpector, and static findings on a durable
  `githubSkillScans` row keyed by skill and content hash
- set `githubScanStatus: "clean"`
- make the skill active/installable

When verification is suspicious:

- persist the final result on the same durable content-hash scan row
- set `githubScanStatus: "suspicious"`
- keep the skill active/installable with suspicious review metadata

When verification fails or is malicious:

- persist the final result on the same durable content-hash scan row
- keep/block the skill from normal install
- return a structured install block such as `github_scan_failed`

Completed clean, suspicious, and malicious verdicts may be reused for the same
skill and content hash. Failed worker runs are not reusable verdicts and may be
requeued for that same content hash after the underlying runtime problem is
fixed. Reusing a result must reassociate it with the skill's current source,
commit, and path before any old-source cleanup can run.

Legacy GitHub-backed rows that have a scan status but no durable
`githubSkillScans` result are not trusted as full ClawScan verdicts. The next
source sync must move them back to pending and enqueue the full pipeline.

GitHub-backed verification must not create a hosted `skillVersions` row or a
ClawHub-owned install artifact. Expired request rows and their temporary stored
files/chunks are pruned, while the small completed `githubSkillScans` result
remains available for the public Security audit page. Source-wide scan-history
cleanup runs in bounded asynchronous batches. Expired request cleanup deletes
the linked worker job before deleting any files, then deletes at most one bounded
GitHub file-metadata chunk per request and schedules an immediate continuation
while work remains. Static findings alone must never promote or block the skill;
the full ClawScan verdict controls `githubScanStatus`.

If the upstream path disappears:

- set `githubCurrentStatus: "missing"`
- set `githubRemovedAt`
- hide the skill with `moderationReason: "github.upstream.removed"`
- block install/update with `github_upstream_removed` or
  `github_upstream_missing`

The row may remain for audit/history, but users must not silently install an old
ClawHub-cached revision after upstream removed or changed it.

## Install Resolver

Normal install/update resolves through ClawHub:

```text
OpenClaw -> ClawHub install resolver -> pinned GitHub descriptor
```

For GitHub-backed skills with a completed non-blocked scan result, ClawHub
returns:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "installKind": "github",
  "github": {
    "repo": "NVIDIA/skills",
    "path": "skills/aiq-deploy",
    "commit": "<40-char sha>",
    "contentHash": "<skill-folder hash>",
    "sourceUrl": "https://github.com/NVIDIA/skills/tree/<sha>/skills/aiq-deploy"
  }
}
```

OpenClaw downloads the GitHub archive for that commit and extracts only the skill
path. The local lock/origin version is the commit SHA.

Controlled skills.sh catalog entries use the repository-qualified reference
`skills-sh:<owner>/<repo>/<slug>`. The legacy slash form
`skills-sh/<owner>/<repo>/<slug>` is invalid for new CLI input and must be
rejected by clients.

Unclaimed mirrored entries remain external and do not create ClawHub scan work.
Their latest successful synchronized snapshot supplies the exact source pointer,
commit, provenance, bounded detail content, upstream checks, and explicit
`Not scanned by ClawHub` trust state. Deletion, reappearance, redirect, and
same-version conflict observations are retained as non-destructive mirror
lifecycle state.

Once a listing enters the adopted/native trust lane, every changed content hash
creates an immutable candidate bound to its repository, path, commit, content
hash, and scan attempt. The prior allowed version remains active and installable
while that candidate is planned, queued, failed, rejected, canceled, or stale.
Only the candidate's own clean or allowed-suspicious verdict may atomically
replace the active version.

Pointer-only changes with the same content hash create immutable provenance
candidates without a new scan. They retain explicit lineage to the original
scan attempt, which remains the security proof exposed by verification.
Rollback restores the most recent prior allowed candidate; rejected and stale
candidates remain in history but are never selected.

The public Test route is `/skills-sh/<owner>/<repo>/<slug>`. Its install resolver
returns the same commit-pinned GitHub descriptor used by native GitHub-backed
skills. Catalog pause, kill, publication disable, and exact-attempt rollback
must fail closed without disabling or mutating native scan work.

Pending verification keeps the skill visible in ClawHub search and detail UI,
but normal install/update returns a structured block:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "reason": "github_verification_pending",
  "status": 423,
  "message": "GitHub-backed skill security scan is in progress. Try again shortly, or rerun with --force-install to install the unverified upstream commit."
}
```

`--force-install` may bypass only pending GitHub-backed verification. It must not
bypass failed, malicious, missing, or removed upstream states.

## No Mirror Contract

ClawHub must not create hosted `skillVersions` or ClawHub download artifacts for
GitHub-backed skills.

`GET /api/v1/download` may still be used as a metered source handoff for current
GitHub-backed skills whose scan verdict is `clean` or `suspicious`. In that case
ClawHub returns only stored fetch coordinates (`sourceRef: "public-github"`,
repo, commit, path, content hash, and an archive URL) after checking current
upstream and scan state. It must not fetch GitHub, expand archives, proxy bytes,
create `skillVersions`, or include detailed scan metadata in the successful
payload.

`GET /api/v1/skills/export` follows the same no-mirror contract. Hosted skills
continue to export stored version files with `sourceRef: "public-clawhub"`.
Current GitHub-backed skills whose scan verdict is `clean` or `suspicious` are
included as `sourceRef: "public-github"` entries with `_source_handoff.json`
coordinates, not ClawHub-hosted source files.

This avoids two NVIDIA concerns:

- Signature drift: any byte-level transformation in a mirror can invalidate
  upstream detached signatures.
- Stale security chain: if a mirror lags after upstream update/removal, users
  might silently install old bytes.

Because installs use GitHub source at a specific commit, ClawHub does not claim
to preserve or verify upstream OMS signatures in v1. Signature verification can
be added later as an additional verification input, but it must not require
ClawHub to republish transformed skill bytes.

## UI

Publisher profiles may group GitHub-backed skills by the parsed `skills.sh.json`
manifest. Skill detail pages read cached `SKILL.md` and optional `skill-card.md`
from `githubSkillContents`.

UI display state is advisory. Installability is controlled by the install
resolver and current scan/upstream state, not by stale cached UI metadata.

## Testing Expectations

Keep coverage for:

- configuring only official publishers
- parsing `skills.sh.json`
- 15-minute cron registration
- new skill -> pending scan -> blocked install
- changed content hash -> pending scan -> no stale commit served
- clean verification -> pinned GitHub install descriptor
- suspicious verification -> pinned GitHub install descriptor with suspicious review metadata
- failed/malicious scan -> blocked install
- removed upstream path -> hidden/blocked install
- cached `SKILL.md` and `skill-card.md` display content
- no `skillVersions` for GitHub-backed skills
- OpenClaw installing the pinned GitHub commit/path rather than ClawHub bytes
